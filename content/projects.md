### Meteo [â†’](https://jmml.me/meteo/)

An [open source](https://github.com/jmml97/meteo) weather app that I was working on to learn SwiftUI. Uses data from AEMET, the Spanish weather agency.

### Web development

Designed and developed [cielos.es](cielos.es), [herminialuque.com](herminialuque.com) and this website.

Also made some [other](https://github.com/jmml97/sibw-practicas) [projects](https://github.com/jmml97/dai-practicas) as part of my CS degree.

### apuntesDGIIM

A [student project](https://github.com/libreim/apuntesDGIIM) which aims to create free and open source textbooks for Computer Science and Mathematics subjects.

In addition to contributing to the writing of the text itself, I created the [templates](https://github.com/jmml97/latex-templates/tree/master/libro-matematicas) used, as well as the [project website](https://libreim.github.io/apuntesDGIIM/), and set up automatic building and deployment.
